Codebase for my master thesis in Data Science LINK:

The code is a compliment to the report, since I have not had time to clean the code. It also requires the files to be formated exactly like the MoodMapper data set in order to work. However it should be possible to rerun the experiment and by tweaking the files be able to apply the method to other data sets.
