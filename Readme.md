# Uniform_Interval_Normalization
Codebase for my master thesis in Data Science LINK:

The code is provided to as a compliment to my thesis Uniform Interval Normalization:Data representation of sparse and noisy data sets for machine learning.

It requires the files to be formated exactly like the MoodMapper data set in order to run without errors. However it should be possible to rerun the experiment and by tweaking the files be able to apply the method to other data sets.
