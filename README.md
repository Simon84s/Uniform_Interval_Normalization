# Uniform_Interval_Normalization
Codebase for my master thesis in Data Science

extract_users_to_files.py: The MoodMapper data sets contained one file per feature, this script extracts and stores the data in one file per user instead
Binning.py: bins a data frame into a time series with equal steps between each data point, fills empty data points with zero
Dist_transform.py: performs the uniform interval normalizaton.
